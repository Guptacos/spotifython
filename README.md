# Spotifython
Python library for interfacing with the Spotify REST api

## Getting Started
TODO: how to get this set up as a pip installable package?

## Read our docs
TODO: add docs to wiki or something

## Important notes:
This library does not currently support all of the functionality provided by
Spotify's REST api. See here (TODO: create unsupported wiki page) for more
information about what specific functionality is and isn't supported. If you
find that certain functionality isn't supported, please reach out (TODO). You
can also use the [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) library, which
currently supports a larger number of Spotify's endpoints than Spotifython does.
